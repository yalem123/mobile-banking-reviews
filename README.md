## üìÇ Repository Structure

| Branch   | Description                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `task-1` | Data Collection and Preprocessing |
| `task-2` | Sentiment and Thematic Analysis   |
| `task-3` | Database, files and report                  |


## Project Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

  * Normalized dates.
  * Saved clean dataset to CSV.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Sentiment and Thematic Analysis

* Applied sentiment analysis using VADER.
* Extracted and clustered keywords using TF-IDF.
* Defined 3-5 key themes per bank.
* Mapped themes to individual reviews.

### Task 3: Database
* Store cleaned data in PostgreSQL database (Neon).
* Define schema for Banks and Reviews tables.
* Insert data using Python.

### Task 4: Insights and Recommendations

* Visualize sentiment trends and rating distributions.
* Identify drivers of satisfaction and pain points.
* Provide actionable recommendations for each bank.
* Document potential review biases.
